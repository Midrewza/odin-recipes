        <h2>Make way for a zesty tropical delight!</h2>
        
        <p>The star of this dish is the pork tenderloin, a lean and tender cut of meat that is marinated in a vibrant blend of Caribbean spices. The marinade typically includes a combination of spices such as cumin, coriander, paprika, allspice, cinnamon, and a touch of chili powder for a subtle kick. These spices come together to create a robust and aromatic flavor profile that adds a unique Caribbean flair to the pork.</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        
        <ul>
            <li>3/4 cup fresh peaches, peeled and diced</li>
            <li>1 small red bell pepper, chopped</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons finely chopped red onion</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons minced fresh cilantro</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon lime juice</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Caribbean jerk seasoning</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried rosemary</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon seasoned salt</li>
            <li>1 pork tenderloin</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Combine peaches, bell pepper, red onion, cilantro, lime juice, garlic, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Set peach salsa aside.</li>
            <li>Combine olive oil, brown sugar, Caribbean jerk seasoning, thyme, rosemary, and seasoned salt in a second small bowl. Rub tenderloin with the spice mixture.</li>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
            <li>Place tenderloin on hot grill and cook covered for 9 to 11 minutes. Turn and grill until tenderloin is slightly pink in the center, 9 to 11 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Remove from heat, cover, and let sit for 5 minutes before slicing. Serve with peach salsa.</li>
